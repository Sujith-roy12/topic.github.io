            <h2>Time Complexity Analysis</h2>
            <p>Time complexity measures how long an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases. Algorithms are categorized using Big-O notation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>O(1): Constant time, regardless of input size.</li>
                <li>O(log n): Very efficient, like binary search.</li>
                <li>O(n): Processes each input once.</li>
                <li>O(n²) or worse: Very slow for large inputs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges in Learning</h3>
            <p>Understanding time complexity can be confusing as it involves abstract thinking and visualizing how algorithms scale with larger inputs.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications</h3>
            <p>Relating theoretical complexity to practical scenarios can be difficult without hands-on examples or practice.</p>
            <h3>Efficient Design Techniques</h3>
            <p>Analyze constraints and problem requirements, starting with simple algorithms and optimizing based on time and space complexity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h2>Binary Search Tree (BST)</h2>
            <p>A Binary Search Tree organizes data so smaller values go left and larger values go right. Operations are efficient in O(log n) time when balanced.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Learning</h3>
            <p>Understanding insertion, deletion, and balancing techniques can be complex, especially for maintaining optimal performance.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications</h3>
            <p>BSTs may not directly relate to real-world problems without context, and balancing adds complexity.</p>
            <h3>Efficient Design Techniques</h3>
            <p>Use balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees to ensure efficient operations for large datasets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h2>DFS and BFS</h2>
            <p>Depth-First Search (DFS) explores deeply before backtracking, while Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores level by level.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Learning</h3>
            <p>Visualizing traversal paths, especially in large graphs, can be difficult. Understanding when to use DFS versus BFS requires practice.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications</h3>
            <p>Translating theoretical traversals into practical applications like network routing or social networks can be challenging.</p>
            <h3>Efficient Design Techniques</h3>
            <p>Choose BFS for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs and DFS for tasks like path existence or topological sorting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h2>Heap</h2>
            <p>A heap is a tree where the root is the smallest or largest value. Useful in priority queues and heapsort.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Learning</h3>
            <p>Grasping insertion and deletion while maintaining the heap property requires understanding "bubbling up" and "bubbling down."</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications</h3>
            <p>Relating heaps to task scheduling or real-time processing systems can be abstract for beginners.</p>
            <h3>Efficient Design Techniques</h3>
            <p>Use heaps for efficient priority-based operations and consider space-time trade-offs for large datasets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h2>Sorting</h2>
            <p>Sorting arranges data in a specific order. Common algorithms include Bubble Sort, Quicksort, and Mergesort.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Learning</h3>
            <p>Understanding time complexity trade-offs and selecting the right algorithm can be challenging, especially with large datasets.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications</h3>
            <p>Deciding the most efficient algorithm for different data sizes and types can be confusing without experience.</p>
            <h3>Efficient Design Techniques</h3>
            <p>Choose algorithms like Quicksort or Mergesort for large datasets, balancing efficiency and memory usage.</p>

            <h2>Pattern Searching</h2>
            <p>Finding one sequence of characters within another using methods like KMP, Rabin-Karp, or Boyer-Moore.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Learning</h3>
            <p>Determining when and why to use specific algorithms can be confusing, especially for optimizing performance.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications</h3>
            <p>Applying pattern searching to practical tasks like text processing or DNA analysis requires understanding specialized algorithms.</p>
            <h3>Efficient Design Techniques</h3>
            <p>Use KMP or Boyer-Moore for efficient text searches, optimizing based on pattern and text sizes.</p>

            <h2>Graph Algorithms</h2>
            <p>Graph algorithms solve problems like finding shortest paths (Dijkstra’s) or minimum spanning trees (Kruskal’s, Prim’s).</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Learning</h3>
            <p>Understanding graph properties and selecting appropriate algorithms for specific problems can be complex.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications</h3>
            <p>Applying algorithms to tasks like navigation or network design requires practical experience and understanding of graph structures.</p>
            <h3>Efficient Design Techniques</h3>
            <p>Analyze graph properties (weighted, directed) and choose algorithms like Dijkstra’s for shortest paths or Kruskal’s for spanning trees.</p>
