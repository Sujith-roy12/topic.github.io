        <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
        <h3>1. Problems We See in Nature: Iteration, Recursion, and Backtracking</h3>
        <p>Problems in nature often involve repeating tasks (iteration), solving parts of the problem in smaller steps (recursion), or exploring all possible solutions to find the best one (backtracking). For example, calculating the Fibonacci sequence uses recursion, while finding the shortest path in a maze can use backtracking. Iteration is seen in repetitive tasks like looping through a list of items. These approaches mirror real-world problem-solving, where breaking down tasks into manageable steps or revisiting choices is common.</p>

        <h3>2. Space and Time Efficiency: Importance and Growth Classes</h3>
        <p>Space and time efficiency help us solve problems faster and with fewer resources. Time efficiency measures how long an algorithm takes, while space efficiency tracks the memory it uses. Both are crucial for scaling solutions to larger problems. Algorithms are classified into growth orders like constant (O(1)), logarithmic (O(log n)), linear (O(n)), or exponential (O(2^n)), which indicate their performance as the input size increases. For example, a sorting algorithm with O(n log n) is more efficient than one with O(n^2) for large datasets.</p>

        <h3>3. Design Principles Takeaway from Chapter 2</h3>
        <p>Design principles guide us in solving problems effectively. Principles like modularity (breaking problems into independent parts), abstraction (focusing on the big picture), and reusability (using existing solutions) simplify complex problems. For instance, creating reusable functions in code reduces redundancy. Another key principle is optimizationâ€”balancing efficiency and simplicity to make solutions both functional and easy to maintain.</p>
