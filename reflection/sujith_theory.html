    <h1>Course Project Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Problem Space and How It Was Arrived At</h2>
    <p>The course project revolved around designing algorithms for urban optimization in city planning. We analysed challenges such as traffic congestion, resource allocation, and public transportation scheduling. Insights were drawn from white papers on smart city frameworks, highlighting the need for algorithmic solutions to enhance urban efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Problem Definition and Team Details</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Management.</p>
    <p><strong>Team Members and Roles:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sneha:</strong> Priority lanes for emergency services and heavy-duty vehicles to deviate them to highways.</li>
        <li><strong>Bhagyashree:</strong> Accident detection and response using AI-powered cameras, alerting authorities, thus reducing the traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sujith:</strong> Smart Parking Guidance: Real-time data on parking availability integrated into traffic systems to guide drivers directly to open spots, reducing unnecessary circling.</li>
        <li><strong>Claudia:</strong> Flood Detection and Rerouting: Monitor roads for flooding during heavy rains and provide instant detours to safer routes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Cases</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Priority lanes for emergency services and heavy-duty vehicles to deviate them to highways:</strong> Priority lanes for emergency and heavy-duty vehicles are essential for managing urban and highway traffic efficiently. It can significantly enhance emergency response capabilities and streamline the movement of critical vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>Accident detection and response using AI-powered cameras:</strong> Detection: AI models analyse video feeds to identify accidents based on sudden traffic. Alerting: Once detected, the system automatically sends alerts to traffic authorities and emergency services with precise location details.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Parking Guidance:</strong> Real-time data on parking availability integrated into traffic systems to guide drivers directly to open spots, reducing unnecessary circling. Smart Parking Guidance systems leverage real-time data to help drivers find available parking spots quickly and efficiently. By integrating IoT sensors, cameras, and traffic systems, these systems eliminate the need for drivers to aimlessly circle parking lots or streets searching for a spot, thereby reducing traffic congestion, saving time, and cutting down fuel consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Flood Detection and Rerouting:</strong> Flood Detection and Rerouting systems use advanced sensors, IoT devices, and AI-powered tools to monitor roads and areas for any signs of flooding during heavy rains. These systems will ensure public safety by detecting flooded areas and guiding drivers to safer and alternate routes. By providing immediate alerts and alternate options, the system helps reduce traffic congestion and prevent accidents.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Kinds of Problems in Nature</h2>
    <p>Nature presents problems requiring iterative, recursive, and backtracking solutions. For instance:</p>
