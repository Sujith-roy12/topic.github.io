    <h1>Priority Lanes for Emergency Services and Heavy-Duty Vehicles</h1>
    <p>Priority lanes are dedicated road lanes designed specifically for emergency services (such as ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles) and heavy-duty vehicles (like trucks and buses). These lanes help ensure faster, safer, and more efficient movement of these vehicles, especially during critical situations or in high-traffic areas.</p>

    <h2>Key Benefits:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Faster Emergency Response:</strong> Priority lanes allow emergency vehicles to bypass regular traffic, significantly reducing response times and potentially saving lives during medical or fire emergencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Traffic Congestion:</strong> By providing a separate lane for heavy-duty vehicles, the regular flow of traffic is improved, minimizing bottlenecks caused by slower or larger vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Safety:</strong> Segregating heavy-duty vehicles reduces the risk of accidents with smaller vehicles, creating a safer driving environment for all road users.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Use of Highways:</strong> Redirecting heavy-duty vehicles to highways optimizes their travel routes and reduces their impact on urban and residential areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation:</h2>
    <p>Priority lanes are typically marked with clear signage and road markings. In smart traffic systems, sensors and cameras can monitor these lanes to ensure compliance and maintain smooth traffic flow.</p>
