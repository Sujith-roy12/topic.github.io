    <h1>Accident Detection and Response Using AI-Powered Cameras</h1>
    <p>
        Accident detection and response systems leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance road safety and traffic management. These systems use AI-powered cameras and sensors installed along roadways to monitor traffic in real-time. When an accident occurs, the AI algorithms analyze video footage or sensor data to detect unusual traffic patterns, such as sudden stops, vehicle collisions, or blockages.

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Alert Authorities:</strong> Automatically notify emergency services, police, or traffic management authorities with precise details about the location and severity of the accident. This accelerates the response time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Real-Time Traffic Management:</strong> Update traffic systems to redirect vehicles around the accident scene, preventing congestion and reducing delays for other drivers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Public Notifications:</strong> Inform drivers via mobile apps, navigation systems, or roadside displays about the incident and suggest alternative routes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Collection:</strong> Record and analyze accident data to identify high-risk areas, improve road safety measures, and guide infrastructure planning.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduced Traffic Congestion:</strong> Quick detection and rerouting help minimize traffic jams caused by accidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster Emergency Response:</strong> Real-time alerts to authorities ensure that medical and emergency services reach the scene promptly, potentially saving lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Safety:</strong> Continuous monitoring creates a safer environment for road users.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Traffic Flow:</strong> By rerouting vehicles, overall traffic efficiency improves, reducing delays for drivers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This technology plays a crucial role in modern traffic systems, improving safety and efficiency while leveraging AI to create smarter roads.
