    <h1>Flood Detection and Rerouting</h1>
    <p>
        Flood Detection and Rerouting systems are designed to monitor road conditions for flooding, 
        particularly during heavy rainfall or other adverse weather events. These systems utilize 
        advanced technology, such as IoT sensors, weather stations, and real-time monitoring cameras, 
        to detect when and where roads have become impassable due to water accumulation.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> The system constantly observes critical areas prone to flooding, ensuring that conditions are assessed promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> It gathers environmental data, such as rainfall intensity, water levels, and drainage system efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Alert Mechanism:</strong> Once flooding is detected, the system triggers alerts to relevant authorities and public traffic management systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Detour Suggestions:</strong> Using traffic mapping tools and navigation systems, the system generates alternate routes to avoid flooded areas, guiding drivers to safer roads.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with Traffic Systems:</strong> It connects seamlessly with traffic management systems to redirect traffic flow and reduce congestion around affected areas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Safety:</strong> By preventing drivers from venturing into dangerous flooded zones, the system reduces accidents and saves lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic Management:</strong> Efficient rerouting ensures smoother traffic flow and minimizes gridlocks during heavy rain.</li>
        <li><strong>Time and Fuel Savings:</strong> Drivers avoid unnecessary delays and detours, leading to better fuel efficiency and reduced commuting times.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> Reduced idling and rerouting contribute to lower emissions, benefiting the environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These systems are particularly critical in urban areas where flooding can severely disrupt transportation and pose risks to public safety. Their ability to act swiftly and intelligently ensures that the community can continue to function effectively, even during challenging weather conditions.
