        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Flood Detection and Rerouting systems are designed to enhance road safety during heavy rains and storms. These systems leverage modern technologies to monitor roads for signs of flooding and provide drivers with instant detours to safer routes, ensuring smooth traffic flow and minimizing risks associated with submerged roads.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><strong>Real-Time Flood Monitoring:</strong> IoT sensors and cameras are strategically placed to monitor water levels on roads and highways.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis and Alerts:</strong> The system processes data collected from sensors and identifies areas prone to flooding.</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Rerouting:</strong> Drivers are provided with real-time detours and alternative routes via navigation apps and digital signage.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Enhanced Safety:</strong> Alerts and detours reduce the risk of accidents caused by flooded roads.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Flow Management:</strong> Prevents congestion in areas affected by flooding by rerouting traffic efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Time and Cost Savings:</strong> Drivers save time and avoid potential vehicle damage caused by floodwaters.</li>
            <li><strong>Preparedness:</strong> Authorities can quickly respond to flooding scenarios with pre-planned rerouting strategies.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Future Potential</h2>
        <p>As cities embrace smart infrastructure, Flood Detection and Rerouting systems can integrate seamlessly with other traffic management solutions, offering predictive analytics to anticipate flood-prone conditions before they occur.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Flood Detection and Rerouting is a crucial innovation in smart city technology. By prioritizing safety and efficiency, these systems ensure that drivers navigate urban environments with confidence, even in adverse weather conditions.</p>
